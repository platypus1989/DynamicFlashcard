# Dynamic Flashcard - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach

**Reference-Based Approach**: Drawing inspiration from successful educational platforms like Duolingo Kids, Khan Academy Kids, and Montessori-style learning apps, focusing on playful engagement, simplicity, and visual clarity optimized for preschool-aged children.

**Design Principles**:
1. **Child-First Interface**: Large touch targets, simple navigation, immediate visual feedback
2. **Dual-Mode Design**: Playful, colorful flashcard mode for children; clean, efficient admin mode for parents/teachers
3. **Visual Hierarchy**: Images dominate, words support, distractions eliminated
4. **Encouraging Progression**: Visual progress indicators that celebrate learning
